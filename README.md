Halo Top Creamery's Reddit Page

================= About ================= <br>
This is the Subreddit page for Halo Top Creamery. I like their ice cream and noticed that they didn't have a subreddit (most likely since the company is still small). I see this as a great opportunity to build my CSS skills as well as create something for someone else. When I've reached a point where I think it's complete I'll reach out to their team to see if they'd like to promote it and/or take it over.

================= Goals ================= <br>

</ol>

================= Additional Information =================<br>
The rest of this repo contains the code I used to make the HTC page. You can also find the page here: <br>
<a href="www.reddit.com/r/HaloTopCreamery"> /r/HaloTopCreamery </a>
The stylesheet can be found here:
<a href="www.reddit.com/r/HaloTopCreamery/about/stylesheet"> HTC Stylesheet Information </a>

For the stylesheet, I did my best to credit the additional code snippets I found to the users that I saw with it first. <br>
Also, a ton of credit to <a href="www.reddit.com/r/csshelp"> /r/CSSHelp </a> and <a href="www.reddit.com/r/selectorlegend"> 
/r/SelectorLegend </a> for all of the additional help with Reddit's stylesheet formatting. Once I got the basics it was much
easier to isolate and modify sections of the page.


Creating this page has been great for solidifying my problem-solving skills and resourcefullness more than anything. There's 
still a lot to learn, but if I continue to play around with the code I'll have enough information to be a fully functional 
web developer.
